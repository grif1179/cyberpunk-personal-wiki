    | Extreme     (2x Range)   | 30 |

*** Automatic Weapons
- If you roll a 1 on an automatic weapon roll (1D10)
  on the reliability table to see if the gun jams.
  | Very Reliable | 3 or lower |
  | Standard      | 5 or lower |

- If you hit roll (1D6/2) to see how many rounds hit
***** Full Auto

  one round hits the target up to the maximum ROF for the weapon.
  + (#_OF_HITS) = (#_POINTS) > (TO_HIT_NUMBER)
  + At Close range for every 10 rounds fired add +1 to your ATK total.
  + At ranges beyond Close subtract -10 from ATK total.
***** Suppressive Fire
- Create a firing zone that makes targets have to
  make a save or be shot with (1D6) rounds.
- (1D10 + REF + ATHLETICS) >= (#_OF_ROUNDS / WIDTH_OF_FIRE_ZONE)
- Minimum width of fire zone is 2m.

** Weapons
*** Shotgun Rules
- Shotguns have a spread that widens as
  you fire at a target farther away.
| Range    | Size of Pattern | Damage   |
| Close/PB | 1m              | full dmg |
| Medium   | 2m              | 3/4 dmg  |
| Long     | 3m              | 1/2 dmg  |

**** Auto-shotguns
- Shots must be placed 1m of each other.
- Each attack has a -2 penalty for every
  additional shot past the first.

*** Grenades
- Can be thrown up to 10x the characters Body Type(BT)
- Can be launched up to 300m
**** Gas Grenades
***** Rules
- Gas differs from other grenade effects
  in that it moves around. To use gas, first
  determine the point of impact. All targets
  within 3 meters are immediately affected.
- On the next turn, determine which way the
  wind is blowing by rolling again on the
  Area Effect Table. Place the new area of
  effect. Any target within the first and second
  areas of effect must save vs the gas, as
  well as any targets in a straight line the
  width of the gas cloud between the two
  points.
- On the third turn, the gas dissipates.
***** Effects
- Gas grenades have either fatal or incapacitating
  effects. To avoid the effects, the
  character must make a save; armor doesn't
  help (although filters or gas masks Will). On
  a successful Save, he will take half effects (a
  -2 REF reduced to -1, 4D6 reduced to 2, etc.).

| Type          | Effect                                 | Damage |
| Nausea        | Illness                                | -4 REF |
| Teargas       | Tearing                                | -2 REF |
| Sleep Drugs   | Sleep (Half effect is -2 to all stats) | None   |
| Biotoxin 1    | Death                                  | 4D6    |
| Biototoxin II | Death                                  | 8D6    |
| Nerve Gas     | Death                                  | 8D10   |

*** RPGs
- (6D10) DMG
- Can't be fired inside without penalty.

** Armor
- Calculate the total SP of your armor + cover, using
  the Proportional Armor rule, to determine how much
  DMG your armor blocks.
  + PROPORTIONAL ARMOR RULE:
    When layering armor, or wearing armor behind an obstacle or cover,
    subtract the smaller SP from the larger one. Find the difference on
    the table below and add it to the larger SP.
    | Diff in SPs | Bonus Number |
    |         0-4 |           +5 |
    |         5-8 |           +4 |
    |        9-14 |           +3 |
    |       15-20 |           +2 |
    |       21-26 |           +1 |
    |         27+ |            0 |

- Total the EVs of all armors, using the Maximum Armor Rule,
  to find out what you must subtract from your REF.
  + MAXIMUM ARMOR RULE:
    Now, in addition to EV, only a maximum
    of 3 layers of Armor can be worn at any one time;
    no more than one of these layers can
    be Hard Armor (see Hard/Soft Armors
    Table). The 2nd layer has an extra EV
    penalty of -1; the 3rd layer, an
    additional penalty of -2. Subdermal
    Armor and Bodyplating cyberware
    options are considered to be armor
    layers; Skinweave is considered a layer,
    but receives no penalty.
