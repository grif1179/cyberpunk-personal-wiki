* Skill Checks
  - For skill checks the players score will be:
    *Players_Score = (1D10 + BASE_SKILL + ONE_SKILL_THAT_APPLIES)*
  - To succeed a players score must be greater than or equal
    the Task Difficulty.
    - Task_Difficulty = (BASE_DIFFICULTY + DIFFICULTY_MOD1 + DIFFICULTY_MOD2 + ... DIFFICULTY_MODN)
  - Players can add luck to the check only if specified before
    the 1D10 roll.
  - If a player rolls a 1 they have an automatic fail
    and must roll on the fumble table.
  - If a player rolls a 10 they have a critical success
    and they roll another 1D10 to add to there roll.
    
** Task Difficulties
| Difficulty        | Check |
|------------------ |------ |
| Easy              |   10+ |
| Average           |   15+ |
| Difficult         |   20+ |
| Very Difficult    |   25+ |
| Nearly Impossible |   30+ |

** Opposed Tasks
   - If you are making an attempt against an-
     other player character, the opposing player
     will combine his most applicable stat, skill
     and 1D10 roll. On an equal or higher roll,
     the defending player wins.

** Difficulty Modifiers
   - Difficulty Modifiers are values which are added to the difficulty of a task,
     reflecting adverse conditions or extra problems. Modifiers work
     best when you are dealing with very ticklish or picky situations;
     things where life and death tasks must be performed. At these times, players
     will want every advantage they can get, and a simple decision like
     "The task is Very Difficult. " will create more. friction than its worth.
     At these times, you will probably want to make the steps of the task clear by
     creating a Difficulty through stacking modifiers. In addition, modifiers allow you,
     as the Referee, to determine the relative difficulty of doing something and the
     effect of prevailing conditions.
